#### The land blending strategy to move forward the land sparing-sharing debate: a theoretical modeling approach

To preserve both biodiversity and agricultural production, two land management strategies have been proposed: land sparing (setting apart natural ecosystems while intensifying agriculture) and land sharing (based on agroecosystems that can support both food production and biodiversity conservation). While the scientific community has been debating which of these strategies is the best, a third solution emerged lately that is a hybrid of the two previous ones. The land sparing-sharing debate is mired in large part because of the influence of the study context which greatly influences its empirical resolution, providing little guidance for generalization. We addressed this challenge using a theoretical modeling approach that allows for better generalization through its ability modify the context. We were interested in the influence of factors specific to the study context on biodiversity and landscape productivity, and therefore on the effectiveness of different landscape management strategies. Our model was based on a controller-pest interaction to focus on ecosystem services important for food production. We implemented in our model factors specific to the study context, such as landscape composition, species parameters, ecosystem services, impact of pest on crops and the planning timescale. Our results confirmed the importance of accounting for study context factors when evaluating landscape management effectiveness. We applied our model to a landscape of cocoa agroforestry, pastures, and natural tropical forests to illustrate the diversity of optimal solutions for landscape management depending on the context, even when study context factors differ only slightly. In all, our results indicate that landscape context is of utmost importance for the best strategy to support both biodiversity and food production. Our modeling approach also showed that a mixed strategy, which we call “land blending strategy”, might provide optimal outcomes for the trade-off between agricultural production and biodiversity while providing flexibility for change and uncertainty.
